# go-examples
repository for golang examples

I started learning Golang few months back. It is really a simple and interesting language.
This repository is a result of my learning. I will continue adding examples as I continue to learn Golang.
In the examples, I have added URLs that I referered while writing it. At some places I have added comments
as part of my understanding.
Any body learning Golang can use, add, modify, edit and share these examples

I have used atom editor and it is very good. Recently I started using Gogland EAP, and it is awesome - But it may not be free in future :( 

I follow [@Todd_McLeod](https://twitter.com/Todd_McLeod). He is an awesome and inspiring teacher.
